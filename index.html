       <p class="services-grandchild">While working with American Red Cross, coordinated the effort to upright an “off-track” project and implemented a Fallback Plan. We performed the Phase II project health assessment to determine failure points. The platform implemented was Adobe Campaign and Experience Manager project engagement leader. Using a project GAP analysis we were able to identify scope creep items and re-align plan. We then collapsed the timeline and budget to critical path to meet timeline.
